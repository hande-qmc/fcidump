fcidump: PSI4 plugin to produce FCIDUMP files
=============================================

It is sometimes convenient to have a quick interface between |PSIfour| and another code.
One such (albeit inefficient) way is to write out all one- and two-electron integrals to
disk.  A format (sadly modified in an ad hoc fashion by other codes) for the filetype
FCIDUMP is given in Comp. Phys. Commun. 54 75 (1989).

Compilation
-----------

First, compile and install |PSIfour|.  To compile the plugin, a makefile containing the
necessary settings must first be produced.  In this directory, run:

::

    $ `psi4 --plugin-compile`
    $ make

Running
-------

The directory containing the fcidump plugin directory must reside either on PSIPATH
(recommended) or PYTHONPATH.  This can be conveniently set in the input file or in the
`~/.psi4rc` file.  Please see the |PSIfour| manual for further details about the plugin
system and running standard SCF calculations.

Assuming this is met, the integral file can be generated by modifying a standard SCF input
file for the desired system to start with

::

    import fcidump


and replacing

::

    energy('scf')

with

::

    energy('fcidump')

For example, the input file:

::

    import fcidump

    molecule {
       Ne  0  0  0
    }

    set {
        basis 6-311g
        scf_type pk
    }

    energy('fcidump')

will run the requested SCF calculation and then write out an FCIDUMP file to the file
`INTDUMP`.

NOTE: if psi4 is run in the same directory as the plugin, PYTHONPATH must be used instead
of PSIPATH.

Basic keywords
--------------

integrals_file
    Filename to which the integrals are written.  Default: `INTDUMP`.

FCIDUMP format
--------------

The FCIDUMP format starts with a Fortran namelist (delimited by &FCI and &END) with the
following options:

NORB
    Integer.  The number of orbitals.
NELEC
    Integer.  The number of electrons.
MS2
    Integer.  The spin polarization of the system, :math:`2 \time M_s`.
ORBSYM
    Integer list.  A comma-separated list containing the symmetry label of each orbital.
    See below for more details.
UHF
    Boolean.  True if underlying SCF calculation is UHF and False if it is RHF.

.. note::

    The number of and indices of orbitals refer to molecular orbitals if generated by an
    RHF calculation and to spin orbitals if generated by a UHF calculation.

The integrals are printed (one per line) after the namelist in the following format::

    x  i  a  j  b

The following cases are permitted:

i, j, a, b are all zero
    x is the nuclear energy (plus the contribution from the frozen core orbitals, if applicable)
a, j, b are both zero
    x is the energy of the i-th orbital
j, b are both zero
    x is the one-body Hamiltonian operator integral between i and a, :math:`\langle i | h | a \rangle = x`.
i, a, j, b are all non-zero
    x is the Coulomb integral, :math:`( i a | j b ) = x`.

Symmetry labels
---------------

A symmetry label corresponds to an irreducible representation of the largest Abelian
subgroup of the molecule, as given in Sec. :ref:`sec:symmetry` of the PSI4 manual.

In a zero-indexed scheme (i.e. subtract one from each label), the exclusive or between
symmetry labels of two irreducible representations gives the label of irreducible
representation which is the result of the direct product of the first two irreducible
representations.  This is extremely convenient as it avoids needing to know the ordering
of the representations or indeed what representation each label corresponds to...
